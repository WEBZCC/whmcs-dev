# WHMCS Development Vagrant Box
A Vagrant box, customised for WHMCS development, built on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa). It sets up all the stuff you're dreading.

## Features
* PHP 7.4
* MySQL 8.0
* ionCube Loaders v10.4.5
* Cron support (every 5 minutes)

## Prerequisites
* Vagrant
* Virtualbox
* A valid WHMCS license (development licenses are fine)
* A copy of WHMCS

## Installation
1. Clone the repo to your local computer
2. Move the WHMCS source code into the `public/whmcs` directory, which should contain an `empty` file.
3. Edit the IP in `Vagrantfile` if you wish
4. Run `vagrant up`
5. Head to `192.168.13.37` (or the IP you changed it to)
6. Follow the on-screen instructions
7. Enjoy, we hope that's eased the development burden!

## Additional options

### Additional databases
You can create additional databases on first provision (or after a `vagrant destroy` and `vagrant up`). You can configure those in `config.json`. By default, only one database will be created, `whmcs_default`.

### Use a hostname
You can create a line in your systems hosts file to use a hostname instead of the boxes IP address. A [guide to edit your hosts file can be found here](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/).

### Create multiple WHMCS installations
The default installation path is `/public/whmcs` but you can move that, or create additional installations as you see fit.

### Cron job
You can remove the cron or change it's frequency as you see fit, just `vagrant-ssh` into the box and run `crontab -e` to edit it.

### Use a WHMCS helper library
[Salmon for WHMCS](https://github.com/grizzlyware/salmon-whmcs) extends many of the default models with extended functionality, making it easier to query the Eloquent models. It also contains an array of helper classes to make common tasks in WHMCS simpler and easier to do.
